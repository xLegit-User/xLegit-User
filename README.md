Hi there! My name is Jossef

I am passionate about Linux and Windows, and I have a strong interest in exploring the possibilities of Mac in the future. With my expertise in IoT and a knack for creating real-life automation solutions, I am able to control a variety of devices using my phone. Additionally, I am a designer and digital asset creator, with a focus on pixel-perfect UI.

In my free time, I enjoy growing hot peppers and organizing hot pepper events in Ramat Gan, the second best city in Israel. I am also an active member of the open-source community, and I am ranked in the top 1% on Stack Overflow.

In 2020, I co-founded Dustico, a software supply chain security company that was acquired by Checkmarx the following year. Since then, I have been working with my team to identify and prevent software supply chain attackers, ensuring the safety of the ecosystem.

Feel free to check out my Github repositories to see some of the projects I have been working on.
